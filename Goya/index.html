		<center>An excerpt from <span class="author">Goya</span>&rsquo;s report to the Academy of San Fernando on the study of art</center>
		<hr>
		Your Excellency,

		<p>In fulfilment, for my part, of Your Excellency&rsquo;s command that each of us should expound what he holds to be advisable for the Study of the Arts, I declare: That Academies should not be exclusive or serve other than as an aid to those who wish freely to study in them. They should banish every trace of the servile subjection of the primary school, mechanical rules, monthly prizes, financial aid and other pettinesses which debase and make effeminate an art as liberal and noble as Painting. Nor should time be allocated to the formal study of Geometry and Perspective with the object of overcoming difficulties in drawing. For drawing necessarily demands them in its own time of those who show disposition and talent. The more they advance in drawing the more easily do they acquire knowledge of the other Arts. This we know from the examples of those who have risen highest in this respect. I do not name them, since the fact is so well known. I shall give a proof to demonstrate with facts that there are no rules in Painting and that the tyranny which obliges everyone, as if they were slaves, to study in the same way or to follow the same method is a great impediment to the Young who practise this very difficult art, which comes closer to the Divine than any other, since it makes known what God has created. Even those who have gone further in the matter can give few rules about the deep play of understanding that is needed, or say how it came about that they were sometimes more successful in a work executed with less care than in one on which they had spent most time. What a profound and impenetrable mystery is locked up in the imitation of divine nature, without which there is nothing good, not only in Painting (which has no other function than the exact imitation of nature) but also in the other sciences!</p>
