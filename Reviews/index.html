		<p id="Rome"><cite>The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</cite>. By <span class="author">B. Ward-Perkins</span>. Oxford U. P., 2005. 239 p., 48 b/w illustrations.</p>
		<p class="review">This well-written and incredibly well-informed book&mdash;obviously the result of a lifetime&rsquo;s reading and excavation&mdash;argues that ancient civilization in the West did indeed end when Rome fell. The first half is fascinating tour of the military and political history of the end of the Roman Empire, while the second half rivetingly describes the amazing material culture that the Romans had, which (sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly) disappeared after the fall of the empire. It has many interesting illustrations, most notably a photo of a sunken Roman trading ship packed full of pottery jars, and a painting of a Pompeian couple showing off their literacy. There is also some interesting discussion of how blatantly scholar&rsquo;s views on the topic are biased by their political leanings.</p>

		<p class="review">A lovely little book which views western art history through the use of shadows.</p>

		<p id="Sargent"><cite>The Portrait of a Lady</cite>. National Gallery of Scotland, 1997. 96 p., 48 color illustrations.</p>
		<p class="review">In many ways this obscure book is the best introduction to Sargent and his world. You learn about his life, and that of a typical sitter, the insouciant Lady Agnew of Lochnaw; how much he charged for a portrait, and what happened at her cheerful dinner parties; his friends, and her family background. There are four essays: the curator, Rolfe, digs into the Agnews&rsquo; history with evident admiration; an art historian, McConkey, writes almost wilfully strangely but is insightful on how portraits were made; a social historian, Cannadine, is chatty and informative on the contemporary decline of the British aristocracy; and a musicologist, Mellers, tries too hard to be perceptive on the art, music, and literature of the time, yet succeeds. It reproduces most every painting of Sargent&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d want to see, including <cite>Madame X</cite> along with his study for it and the photograph of the original version (p. 70), his portraits of dancers, actresses, and singers, and some other famous portraits of the titled or wealthy. It also gives a sample of the other portrait painters of the time, so that you can judge Sargent in context. And you&rsquo;ll enjoy the story of J. Pierpont Morgan, on a visit from America, marking a few items in a catalog and then asking to buy all the others (p. 40).</p>
