		<p id="Rome"><span class="author">B. Ward-Perkins</span>: <cite>The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</cite>. 239 p., 48 b/w illustrations. Oxford University Press, 2005.</p>
		<p class="review">This well-written and incredibly well-informed book&mdash;obviously the result of a lifetime&rsquo;s reading and excavation&mdash;argues that ancient civilization in the West did indeed end when Rome fell. The first half is fascinating tour of the military and political history of the end of the Roman Empire, while the second half rivetingly describes the amazing material culture that the Romans had, which (sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly) disappeared after the fall of the empire. It has many interesting illustrations, most notably a photo of a sunken Roman trading ship packed full of pottery jars, and a painting of a Pompeian couple showing off their literacy. There is also some interesting discussion of how blatantly scholar&rsquo;s views on the topic are biased by their political leanings.</p>

		<p class="review">A lovely little book which views western art history through the use of shadows, with mainly color plates.</p>

		<p id="Tintin"><span class="author">S. Spielberg</span>: <cite>The Adventures of Tintin</cite>. 1:47 hours. Paramount, 2011.</p>
		<p class="review">Exciting and hilarious, a loose adaptation of three Tintin comics set in a mishmash of Brussels and London, with two amazing setpiece sea-battle scenes in the middle.</p>
