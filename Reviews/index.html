		<p id="Rome"><cite>The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization</cite>. <span class="author">B. Ward-Perkins</span>. Oxford U. P., 2005. 239 p., 48 b/w illustrations.</p>
		<p class="review">This well-written and incredibly well-informed book&mdash;obviously the result of a lifetime&rsquo;s reading and excavation&mdash;argues that ancient civilization in the West did indeed end when Rome fell. The first half is fascinating tour of the military and political history of the end of the Roman Empire, while the second half rivetingly describes the amazing material culture that the Romans had, which (sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly) disappeared after the fall of the empire. It has many interesting illustrations, most notably a photo of a sunken Roman trading ship packed full of pottery jars, and a painting of a Pompeian couple showing off their literacy. There is also some interesting discussion of how blatantly scholar&rsquo;s views on the topic are biased by their political leanings.</p>
