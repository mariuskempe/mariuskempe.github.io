		<p class="quote"><em>&ldquo;[Fej&eacute;r] could perceive the significance, the beauty, and the promise of a rather concrete, not too large problem <small>[&hellip;]</small> and, when he had found the solution, he kept on working at it with loving care, till each detail became fully intuitive and the connection of the details in a well-ordered whole fully transparent. It is due to such care spent on the elaboration of the solution that <small>[&hellip;]</small> most of his proofs appear very clear and simple.&rdquo;</em></p>

		<small>
		The epigraph is from <a href="Obituary.pdf">P&oacute;lya&rsquo;s obituary of Fej&eacute;r</a>.<br>
		The visual approach is inspired by <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/199901/rev-casselman.pdf">Bill Casselman&rsquo;s review of Tufte&rsquo;s <cite>Visual Explanations</cite></a>.<br>
		The proof was first published in chapter 6 of <cite>The Enjoyment of Mathematics</cite> by Rademacher & Toeplitz.<br>
		The problem was first posed and solved by G. F. Fagnano in <cite>Nova Acta Eruditorum</cite> (1775): 281-303.<br>
