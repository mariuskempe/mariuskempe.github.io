		 <p><em>&ldquo;The net result is that in all physics nothing has shown up indicating an intrinsic difference of left and right.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 20</small></p>
		<p class="commentary">Four years after the book was published, physicists discovered a fundamental left&ndash;right asymmetry.

		<p><em>&ldquo;It seems difficult to devise physical laws in which they are not intrinsically alike; but the negative counterpart of the positively charged proton still remains to be discovered.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 25</small></p>
		<p class="commentary">This was discovered even sooner, three years after the book&rsquo;s publication, and is now called the &lsquo;antiproton&rsquo;. see the feynman etc above.</p><br>
		
		<p><em>&ldquo;Haeckel&rsquo;s extraordinary work, in which his interest in the concrete forms of organisms finds expression in countless drawings executed in minutest detail, is a true nature&rsquo;s codex of symmetry.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 60 &mdash; figures on p. 59, 61, 75 & 89</small></p>
		<p class="commentary">Here is an excerpt of a letter from D&rsquo;Arcy Thompson to H.S.M. Coxeter that Coxeter quoted in <a href="Coxeter.pdf">his review of the book in the American Mathematical Monthly</a>:</p>
		<p class="quote"><small>&ldquo;As to Haeckel, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust him round the corner, and I have the gravest doubt whether his pentagonal dodecahedron and various others ever existed outside his fertile fancy. I believe I may safely say that no type&ndash;specimens of these exist in the British Museum, or anywhere else. He was an artist, a pattern&ndash;designer, a skilled draughtsman. He had a minute professorial salary in a small University. The <em>Challenger</em> paid eight guineas apiece for as many plates as he chose to draw; and he kept on drawing them, and lived on the proceeds (so they used to say) till the end of his life. He represents a thoroughly bad period in Natural Science.&rdquo;</small></p>

		<p><em>&ldquo;While pentagonal symmetry is frequent in the organic world, one does not find it among the most perfectly symmetrical creations of inorganic nature, among the crystals.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 63</small></p>
		<p class="commentary">While the theorems of course continue to hold true, chemists have since discovered crystals with five-fold symmetry of sorts, called &lsquo;quasicrystals&rsquo;.</p>

		<p><em>&ldquo;I am inclined to believe that Lord Kelvin&rsquo;s configuration gives the absolute minimum; but so far as I know, this has never been proved.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 93</small></p>
		<p class="commentary">In fact, a better structure was discovered by <a href="Weaire & Phelan.pdf">Weaire & Phelan</a>. It is not known whether it is optimal.</p>

		<p><em>&ldquo;Examples for all 17 groups of symmetry are found among the decorative patterns of antiquity, in particular among the Egyptian ornaments.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 103</small></p>

		<p><em>&ldquo;Strangely enough the proof was carried out only as late as 1924 by George P&oacute;lya, now teaching at Stanford.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 104</small></p>
		<p class="commentary">Actually the proof was first given by E.S. Fedorov in 1891 <small>[&lsquo;Symmetry in the plane&rsquo;, <cite>Proceedings of the Imperial St. Petersburg Mineralogical Society</cite>]</small>, though P&oacute;lya discovered it independently.</p><br>

		<p><em>&ldquo;Galois&rsquo; ideas, which for several decades remained a book with seven seals but later exerted a more and more profound influence upon the whole development of mathematics, are contained in a farewell letter written to a friend on the eve of his death, which he met in a silly duel at the age of twenty-one.&rdquo;</em><small>, p. 104</small></p>
		<p class="commentary">This letter was actually only a sketch of various results Galois had obtained. His most important work was <a href="Galois.pdf">a memoir on the solvability of algebraic equations</a> which he had been submitting versions of to the <em>Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences</em> every year for three years previous to his death, and which was finally published by Liouville in his journal in 1846. Also, Galois died at twenty.</p>
