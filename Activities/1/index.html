		<p>You&rsquo;re journeying with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage, and you reach a river. You have a raft, but you can only take one of them with you at a time. If you leave the wolf and goat alone the wolf will eat the goat, and if you leave the goat and cabbage alone the goat will eat the cabbage. Can you get them all across safely?</p>
